The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nTroubleshooting\n- If anything goes wrong or cookies are not being deleted:\n1. Clear all your cookies (start with a clean slate)\n2. Reset settings other cookie extensions might have made in about:config -> restore default of all network.cookie.* preferences\n3. WebExtension Cookie API is not compatible with first party isolation so make sure privacy.firstparty.isolate = false (this is fixed for Firefox 59+, make sure to restart the browser after enabling in about:config). Make sure you clear your cookies after changing this setting.\n\n- If you are coming from SDC and find that some cookies are deleted on shutdown, it's probably because SDC still has it whitelist intact in Firefox permissions. In this case, try deleting permissions.sqlite in your profile.\n\n- If you get notifications for a google cookie (with the name: NID) that can't be deleted, then it's probably this Firefox bug. The workaround is to just delete that cookie from Firefox's cookie manager.\n\n- The Default Setting will clear any storage (including whitelists) made by the extension, but it is essentially a \"clean slate\".\n\n- If nothing works, then you can make a new profile and see if the issue persists there.\n\n- If a new profile still doesn't work or if you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":9470,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Kenny Do","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/anonymous-8bc6cd6a45c7c386b10ad255c60b79b2/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1507873221","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.png?modified=1507873221","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":125,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1507873217","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.png?modified=1507873217","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":65,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1507873221","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.png?modified=1507873221","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":125,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1507873221","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.png?modified=1507873221","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":125,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/mrkennyd/5","averageRating":4.4478,"reviewCount":298,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1526253911000},{"id":"87677a2c52b84ad3a151a4a72f5bd3c4@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/566/566314-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/566/566314-64.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Grammarly for Firefox","version":"8.826.1639","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/959283/grammarly_for_firefox-8.826.1639-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":4873535,"homepageURL":"http://grammarly.com","supportURL":null,"description":"Grammarly will help you communicate more effectively.

The Google Container extension helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Google.","fullDescription":"THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL ADDON FROM MOZILLA! It is a fork of the Facebook Container addon.\n\nWhat does it do?\nGoogle Container works by isolating your Google identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Google to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension deletes your Google cookies and logs you out of Google.\nThe next time you navigate to Google it will load in a new red colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Google normally when in the Google Container. If you click on a non-Google link or navigate to a non-Google website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Google Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Google Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Google about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Google only in the Container, embedded Google comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Google Container will not work. This prevents Google from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Google to your Google identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Google credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Google use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Google Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Google from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Google still will have access to everything that you do while you are on google.com.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Google tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Google activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Google settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWe do never collect any data, all the data we see, you see.\n\nOther Containers\nGoogle Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Google Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. You should also check out Temporary Containers .\n\nNOTE: If you are a Firefox Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Google to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Google Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign google.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nRecommended privacy enhancing Add-ons\n\n    Decentraleyes:  Protects you against tracking through “free”, centralized, content delivery by automatically injecting local resources if possible.\n    Don’t track me google : If your search-engine of choice happens to be Google this Add-on will remove the tracking automatically placed on result-links. Or just use startpage.com instead.\n    HTTPS Everywhere:  Automatically redirects you to the secure version of websites if available.\n    Request Control: Lets you filter session, ref, utm and more query parameters from URLs and can also circumvent outgoing trackers on websites\n    uBlock Origin  I guess you already know this one.
